                                    This method keeps the free/busy list of jobs organized by memory location,
                                    low-ordered to high-ordered memory. In this method, first job claims the first
                                    available memory with space more than or equal to it’s size. The operating system
                                    doesn’t search for appropriate partition but just allocate the job to the nearest
                                    memory partition available with sufficient size
                                </div>

                        <h4 style="padding-top: 10px;">Advantages</h4>
                        <p>
                            It is fast in processing. As the processor allocates the nearest available memory partition
                            to the job, it is very fast in execution.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <p>
                            It wastes a lot of memory. The processor ignores if the size of partition allocated to the
                            job is very large as compared to the size of job or not. It just allocates the memory. As a
                            result, a lot of memory is wasted and many jobs may not get space in the memory, and would
                            have to wait for another job to complete.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <div>
                                    Next fit is a modified version of ‘first fit’. It begins as the first fit to find a
                                    free partition but when called next time it starts searching from where it left off,
                                    not from the beginning. This policy makes use of a roving pointer. The pointer moves
                                    along the memory chain to search for a next fit. This helps in, to avoid the usage
                                    of memory always from the head (beginning) of the free block chain.
                                </div>
                            </li>

                        <h4 style="padding-top: 10px;">Advantages</h4>
                        <p>Next fit is a very fast searching algorithm and is also comparatively faster than First Fit
                            and Best Fit Memory Management Algorithms.</p>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <p>
                            It is more difficult to implement than first fit. It can allocate only the next free holes
                            even if previous ones are sufficiently large
                        </p>

                    </div></li>
                    <hr class = "my-4">
                    <li><div class="pt-4 pt-lg-6 content d-flex flex-column justify-content-center"
                        data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
                        <h3><u>Best Fit</u></h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <div>
                                    The best fit deals with allocating the smallest free partition which meets the
                                    requirement of the requesting process. This algorithm first searches the entire list
                                    of free partitions and considers the smallest hole that is adequate. It then tries
                                    to find a hole which is close to actual process size needed.
                                </div>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 style="padding-top: 10px;">Advantages</h4>
                        <p>
                            Memory utilization is much better than first fit as it searches the smallest free partition
                            first available.</p>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <p>
                            It is slower and may even tend to fill up memory with tiny useless holes.
                        </p>

                        <h3><u>Worst Fit</u></h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <div>
                                    Worst Fit allocates a process to the partition which is largest sufficient among the
                                    freely available partitions available in the main memory. If a large process comes
                                    at a later stage, then memory will not have space to accommodate it
                                </div>
                            </li>

                        <h4 style="padding-top: 10px;">Advantages</h4>
                        <p>
                            Since this process chooses the largest hole/partition, therefore there will be large
                            internal fragmentation. Now, this internal fragmentation will be quite big so that other
                            small processes can also be placed in that leftover partition. </p>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <p>
                            It is a slow process because it traverses all the partitions in the memory and then selects
                            the largest partition among all the partitions, which is a time-consuming process.
