            <h1>Non - Contigous memory Allocation</h1>

            <h1>Paging</h1>

            <p>It involves dividing the logical memory of a process into fixed-size blocks called pages, typically ranging from 4 KB to 64 KB in size. 
                Pages in paging need not be contiguous in physical memory, which reduces external fragmentation. Each process has a page table that maps
                logical addresses (page numbers) to physical addresses (frame numbers) in main memory. This translation is managed by the operating system's 
                Memory Management Unit (MMU) in hardware. Paging supports virtual memory systems by allowing processes to use more memory than physically available,
                and it enables efficient memory allocation and management through mechanisms like page faults handling, swapping, and eviction strategies. Overall, paging
                is crucial for modern computer systems, ensuring efficient memory utilization and supporting the execution of multiple processes concurrently.

            <p>
                These  are techniques used by operating systems to decide which memory pages to swap out (evict) when a new page needs to be brought in (paged in) due to a page fault.
