            <h1>Deadlock</h1>
            <p>
                Deadlock occurs when two or more processes or threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the others to release resources. Essentially, it's a situation where no progress can be made. 
                <br></br>

                <h3>Deadlock typically happens under four conditions:</h3>
                
                1) Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode. Otherwise, the process would not be forced to wait.
                <br></br>
                
                2)Hold and Wait: A process must be holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes.
                <br></br>

                3)No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process; they must be explicitly released by the process holding them.
                <br></br>

                4)Circular Wait: There are a set of processes {P0, P1, ..., Pn} where P0 is waiting for a resource that is held by P1, P1 is waiting for a resource that is held by P2, ..., Pn is waiting for a resource that is held by P0.

                A graph-based algorithm where processes and resources are represented as nodes and edges, respectively, to detect cycles indicating potential deadlocks.
